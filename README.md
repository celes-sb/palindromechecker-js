# Palindrome Checker

https://celes-sb.github.io/palindrome-checker-js/

Part of the freeCodeCamp.org Curriculum  
JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

As part of my journey to obtain the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from freeCodeCamp.org, I am excited to share what I am learning. This project, the Palindrome Checker, is one of the many examples of the practical applications and challenges included in the curriculum.

## About the Project

The Palindrome Checker is a JavaScript project designed to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). This exercise not only reinforces fundamental programming concepts but also provides an opportunity to explore string manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- **Algorithms**: Understanding how to develop efficient algorithms to solve problems related to string manipulation.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizing appropriate data structures to handle and process input data.
- **JavaScript**: Applying JavaScript fundamentals to build functional and dynamic applications.
- **Problem-Solving**: Enhancing problem-solving skills through hands-on practice and algorithmic thinking.

## Why Share This?

By sharing my progress and projects, I aim to:

- **Build a Portfolio**: Demonstrate my skills and knowledge in JavaScript and related technologies.
- **Document My Learning**: Keep track of my learning journey and reflect on my progress.
- **Help Others**: Provide insights and resources for others who are also pursuing similar learning paths.

Stay tuned for more projects and updates as I continue to explore the fascinating world of JavaScript and web development!
